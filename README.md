BasicFinancialFramework
=======================

My basic framework code for financial domain to combine a few design patterns. This was created using Eclipse IDE. The output of this project is a JAR file that the Bank Application and Credit Card Application would use as the base framework. This project does not include any real persistance as the objective is to only experiment on design patterns.
